As with all innovative start-ups, a lot of things change over a short period of time. Folks who join in later on in the process tend to end up more confused due to the lack of shared context. Hopefully this bit (if you are interested) can help alleviate some of that confusion. It's also totally cool if you don't care and just want to do your job (because honestly, you don't REALLY need to know all this).

If you are completely new to all of this and sometimes hear references to [Coil](https://coil.com/), you might be wondering what a wound length of concentric rings has anything to do with us. Excellent question! Back in 2015, [Stefan Thomas](https://justmoon.com/) and [Evan Schwartz](https://github.com/emschwartz) released a whitepaper titled [A Protocol for Interledger Payments](https://interledger.org/developers/documents/interledger.pdf) which proposed a protocol for payments across payment systems by enabling secure transfers between ledgers.

Along with the publication of the whitepaper, Adrian (yes, Fynbos Adrian) also proposed the [Interledger Payments Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/interledger/) at the W3C. As commerce moves increasingly to the web, the W3C has a vested interest in developing open standards for web payments and security by getting those with interest and knowledge involved with the W3C.

In August 2019, Adrian Hope-Bailie proposed the [Web Monetization API](https://web.archive.org/web/20230521023112/https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785) on the WICG Discourse. It is a Javascript browser API that allows the creation of a payment stream from the user agent to the website, allowing content creators to receive micro-payments from folks consuming their content on the web.

This use-case alone, however, was insufficient to grow adoption of the technology. The tipping use-case was proposed but in order to achieve that, we had to go through the arduous process of licensing and all that jazz to become a full-fledged digital wallet. Fynbos was spun off to pursue that path.

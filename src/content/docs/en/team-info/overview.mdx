Welcome to the Interledger Foundation. Joining a new team can be a disorienting experience, especially in a fully remote organisation like ours. But we hope that we can ease you into your new role by providing an overview of what we are all about.

## Who we are

### Technology team

If you are a member of the tech team, you should be in the following Slack channels:

- [#ilf-tech](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/C04DCGM8L3H)
- [#tech-team](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/C05EMHTG6FM)
- [#tech-standups](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/C039CE49W12)

Our tech team is relatively large now, and we're in the process of building out better communications strategies across our different projects. Please stay tuned. Also check out our [tech team page](/en/team-info/tech-team/).

## How we work

We are a **fully remote organization** with colleagues based in 11 countries around the world, here's some helpful information about how to work effectively together.

### Timezones

We'd recommend using a [world clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) to check when you're scheduling meetings to find a time that works for everyone. We recognise sometimes that might mean working flexibly - but please ensure no one is required to work regularly outside their hours for internal meetings.

You can also include in your email signature the following text:

> Please note that because of my hybrid and global work, I am sending this message at a time that works for me. I do not expect a response outside your working hours. I appreciate your understanding.

### Calendar

We suggest **blocking out your calendar** if there are times of the day when you are not available. This helps when people need to schedule meetings with you. We also encourage the use of the [Pingboard Calendar](https://interledgerfoundation.pingboard.com/calendar) to indicate your status if there's something going on for a day or more. The Pingboard Calendar is synced to your Google Calendar.

### Communication channels

Our main communication channel is the [Interledger Foundation Slack](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com). In addition to direct messages, you can join or set up channels around specific topics. Make use of the Canvas function to attach files or add notes to your conversations.

Because we are fully remote, we need everyone to put in a little more effort in **sharing key decisions** with the bigger group. When any changes are introduced, we should at least write a short update in our respective team channel and **tag the impacted people**. Some additional Slack etiquette include:

- Using threads to keep channels organized, scannable & avoid tons of notifications
- Using `@here` or `@channel` when appropriate
- Using the [#general](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNSN1KTGV) channel for information that everybody at the ILF should know about
- Using the [#ilf](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/C028FLRC1BQ) channel for information that only pertains to non-contract staff members
- [optional] Setting do not disturb hours so people know that you will get to them when they are awake/online

There is also an [Interledger Slack](https://interledger.slack.com), which is public and used for the wider community to connect, this is a great place to stay up to date with everything that is happening across the ecosystem.

### Meeting software

Every team member has a Zoom account. If you are recording meetings this is the best option to use so you can save your recordings to your account. We can also add Google Meet into calendar invites or use the Huddle function on Slack.

Remember to check the calendar of the people you're inviting to the meeting to minimise clashing with their other meetings. When you do send the invite, don't forget to add the method to join your meeting to the invite.

### Meeting structures

Although meetings are an important part of our days, it's also easy to fill your diary with meetings without adequate breaks or time to complete other work. Think about shortening meetings and keeping them **structured with an agenda**. And always **take meeting notes** and **follow up on action items**.

It's helpful to think about what type of meeting you need. It could be a 15-20 min update meeting, a 30 min information sharing session or a 45 min discussion. Your time is valuable - use it wisely!

### Google Drive

All documents should be created and stored in the [ILF Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AGHBWw9n689MUk9PVA). Please ask your team or manager which folders your team uses and how your team structures documents. This ensures that all information is **easily shared** between team members and across teams throughout the organisation.

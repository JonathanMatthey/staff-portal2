This page is all about the Interledger Operations team. If you have any suggestions (like adding a random dancing hamster gif which pops up at random) or objections (like rewording any or all of the nonsense on this page), please ping [Hui Jing](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U059PUZ7TA9) on Slack. If the tone of voice of this page sounds oddly similar to that of the [tech team](/en/team-info/tech-team/) page, well, it's because Hui Jing wrote the copy for both and nobody bothered to request for changes.

Do join our [#ops](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/archives/C02V3NZQZQZ) Slack channel because that's where everyone in the organization can ask Operations related questions, from HR to Finance to IT and someone from your friendly Ops Squad will answer your query. If it is something that concerns sensitive information, then please do use a private channel of communication like email or DM, but for everything else, we want information to be easily searchable by other folks in the team who have the same question.

Compared to the other departments who start from the ground and aim to shoot for the moon, our team starts sea level and endeavours not to let the ship sink below the surface. We are special that way. And even though we don't have regular ground-breaking and exciting updates, we take pride in delivering consistent quality for the rest of the organization.

In the spirit of sharing knowledge, the Operations team sends out several series of newsletters to give the rest of the organization a window into how we work.

## Our peoples!

Currently, Operations is a team of 5, check us out on [Pingboard](https://interledgerfoundation.pingboard.com/org_chart?filter_by=80033335) (oh my god, please use Pingboard more, we most definitely paid for it). We are broadly split into 3 departments but the venn diagram is very overlapped.

### Finance department

Our Finance department is led by our one and only Director of Finance, [Florence Cassemere](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U05GYJWN6GN) (AKA Flo), and supported by our Operations Associate, [Dacia Fournier](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U05RK3JB0LT). Anything at the ILF that has a currency symbol attached is our concern. For everybody internal and external to the ILF to get paid on time and correctly, the team has to make sure all transactions are properly accounted for and compliant with our policies.

We are a US-registered 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit, and therefore have annual audit requirements. We endeavour to maintain an audit opinion so clean you could eat off it. And that's why we will chase you down when there is any missing documentation that could potentially be flagged by the auditors.

### HR department

Our HR department is our Director of HR & Operations, [Joana Telker](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U081LBB82QZ). Even though she only joined us in January 2025, she has hit the ground running and busy with making sure our team is being taken care of such that they can focus on their main tasks and responsibilities.

We are refreshing our organizational policies to better reflect the make-up of our team as well documenting a lot of the processes that have previously been just communicated via word of mouth. That worked fine when the team was smaller but we've grown quite a lot since then and our processes and policies need to reflect that growth.

### IT department

Our IT department is made up of [Chen Hui Jing](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U059PUZ7TA9), [Mihai Ola](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U06R77ZS9K2) and in the unfortunate event that both of us get hit by buses, then [Alex Lakatos](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U027Q4DV03X) (yes, you heard right, it's boss man, that Alex) as the last resort backup.

We keep track of all hardware devices as well as software services and accounts used at the ILF. It is also important that we monitor for any security threats and will always be on hand to answer the team's IT questions, and step in to help when someone accidentally steps into a security landmine. Hackers and scammers are getting better at spear-phishing attacks so we preach constant vigilance!

Check out our IT information page to find links to our cybersecurity training platform, IT policies manual and instructions for installing SentinelOne, which is our endpoint protection platform.

### Everything else Operations

There are many other things that don't fall cleanly into a single department and our Ops Squad works together to tackle those. We also work together with a number of external service providers that boost our capabilities in the area of accounting, legal counsel, corporate insurance and so on. Our current COO, [Hui Jing](https://interledgerfoundation.slack.com/team/U059PUZ7TA9), will work together with Flo and Joana to tackle any Operations issues that arise over our course of existing in this world.

Our aim is to increase access to digital financial services for the 1.4 billion people worldwide who are currently excluded from traditional banking systems. We do this by making it easier to send money to anyone, anywhere. When payments are powered by Interledger, transactions are not limited to a particular bank, mobile money provider, or location.

## ILF Brand

Interledger Foundation is the overarching brand that acts as a "container" for all the work we do. Underneath the Foundation are 4 brand pillars which are:

<div class="brand-pillars">

### Our vision

**A world where everyone can send a payment as easily as an email.**

The primary color for vision is purple, which is used for the Communications team to inspire people about our work. Read our [vision page](/pillars/vision) for more details.

### Our mission

**Build equity and inclusion within Interledger, the interoperable global payments network.**

The primary color for mission is orange, which is used for the Programs team to show what we are working on now. Read our [mission page](/pillars/mission) for more details.

### Our technology

**We believe that payment networks should be interoperable to remove barriers to participating in the global financial ecosystem.**

The primary color for technology is teal, which is used for the Technology team to promote our Open Standards and technology. Read our [technology page](/pillars/technology) for more details.

### Our values

**Be open, inclusive, and innovative.**

The primary color for values is pink, which is used for the HR and Operations team to show how we work. Read our [values page](/pillars/values) for more details.

## How we use our brand pillars

Through creating a visual reference for the brand pillars, people can build their collateral based on the subject matter being discussed. It has configurability built into the application of design principles, to enable consistency and cohesion.

It is not department or person specific but speaks to the organizational structure that underpins our work.

- What we are working towards (Vision)
- What we are doing now (Mission)
- How we work (Values)
- How we make things real (Technology)

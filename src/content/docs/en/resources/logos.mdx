Our logos are an integral part of the Interledger brand identity, and we must minimise inconsistencies that could hurt our logo and brand recognition. Please make sure that you understand our logo usage guidelines clearly, especially the sections that show how the logos should be used.

## Restrictions on naming, logos and co-branding Interledger Foundation

### 1. Logo

The logo is the core representation of our brand. Always use the official logo files and ensure clarity and visibility.

**Usage Rules:**

- Maintain sufficient clear space around the logo (equal to the height of the icon element in the logo).
- Always use the logo at its original proportions—never stretch, distort, or rotate.
- Use the primary logo in full color whenever possible.

### 2. Logo Variations

To maintain flexibility, we offer different versions of the logo for various applications.

- Full-Color Logo: Preferred for all standard branding materials.
- Monochrome Logo: Use when color printing is not available.
- Reversed (White) Logo: Use on dark backgrounds for visibility.
- Icon-Only Logo: Use for favicons, social media profiles, and small-scale branding.

### 3. Minimum Size & Clear Space

To ensure readability and brand recognition.

**Minimum Size:**

- Print: The logo should never be smaller than 7 mm in height.
- Digital: The logo should never be smaller than 30 px in height.
- Clear Space: Maintain at least 1 x times the height of the logo's icon element as padding around it.

### 4. Incorrect Logo Usage

**Do not:**

- ❌ Alter the proportions, colors, or fonts.
- ❌ Add effects like shadows, gradients, or outlines.
- ❌ Place the logo on low-contrast or busy backgrounds.
- ❌ Use outdated or unapproved versions of the logo.
- ❌ Crop or rearrange logo elements.

Always use approved logo files and formats provided by the brand team. For any logo-related inquiries or special use cases, contact Anna Sheard at [anna@interledger.org](mailto:anna@interledger.org)

## Co-branding

When placing any logo next to other logos in horizontal or vertical orientation attempt to make all logos appear visually equivalent, with appropriate and visually consistent spacing. The spacing is equivalent with the height of the logo symbol.

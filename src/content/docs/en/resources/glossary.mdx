Within the Interledger Foundation, there are a number of terms that are regularly used. For the sake of consistency and to ensure we are all on the same page, the following is a list of terms and what they refer to when used in the context of Interledger. If there is a term that you have come across which is not on the list, please add it to our [working Glossary spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gs3URtKBf07njXmE15R3flkBnCK6KiYlMr4ss1XiLIE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Terms

**Account servicing entity (ASE)**
An entity that provides and maintains payment accounts for payers and payees. ASEs that maintain financial accounts are regulated entities within the countries they operate. Examples include digital wallet providers, banks, crypto wallets, and mobile money providers.

**Asset**
An Asset consists of two pieces of information, code and scale. The asset code SHOULD be an ISO 4217 currency code. The asset scale is the difference in orders of magnitude between the standard unit and a corresponding fractional unit.

**Closed network**

**Data normalization**

**Fiat currency**

**Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol (GNAP)**
The Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol (GNAP) defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of software, and conveying the results and artifacts of that delegation to the software. This delegation can include access to a set of APIs as well as subject information passed directly to the software. For more information, see the specification.

**Interledger Protocol**
Interledger is a protocol for sending packets of money across different payment networks or ledgers. For more details, see the specification.

**Interoperability**
_Definition pending_

**Ledger**
_Definition pending_

**Micro payments**
_Definition pending_

**Open Payments (OP)**
Open Payments is a specification and set of APIs that define standards for access to digital payment accounts.

When an ASE implements Open Payments on its customers' accounts, third-party applications and other entities can initiate payments from their users' payment accounts (with permission).

Open Payments-enabled accounts are assigned one or more wallet addresses. Wallet addresses are a required component of Web Monetization.

**Open protocol**
_Definition pending_

**Open source**
_Definition pending_

**Payment pointer**
A payment pointer is a type of Open Payments wallet address that supports Interledger payments. Payment pointer addresses begin with $ instead of https://. For example, $wallet.example.com/alice.

Each payment pointer resolves to a URL with the HTTPS scheme. Because the href value in a monetization `<link>` must be a URL, you must convert a payment pointer to its URL equivalent. Enter your payment pointer into the field provided on paymentpointers.org to get the URL.

**Peer**
A Peer is a counterparty that a given party transacts with. Within the Interledger Protocol, connectors maintain peers, or counterparty connectors whom they transact with. For more information, see the peering documentation.

**Simple Payments Setup Protocol (SPSP)**
The Simple Payments Setup Protocol is a basic protocol for exchanging payment information between payee and payer to facilitate payment over Interledger. For more details, see the SPSP specification.

**STREAM**
STREAM is a multiplexed Interledger Transport Protocol that provides for sending multiple "streams" of money and data between two parties using ILP. For more details, see the STREAM specification.

**TigerBeetle**
TigerBeetle is a distributed financial accounting database designed for mission critical safety and performance. For more information, see the official website.

**User agent**
A user agent is a computer program representing or acting on behalf of a person. A web browser is a common example of a user agent.

**Wallet address**
A wallet address is a secure, unique URL that represents an Open Payments-enabled account. Each wallet address provides an entry point to the Open Payments APIs, allowing the site visitor's software to get the details it needs to set up a payment.

Similar to how an email address is a publicly shareable ID for an email account, a wallet address is a publicly shareable payment address for the underlying account. Knowing someone's wallet address in no way allows unauthorized access to, or payments from, the account itself.
